# ComputerCraftThings

Things I have programmed in ComputerCraft, including branches for turtles and (soon) PDA's. All of the scripts here are designed for [CC: Tweaked](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cc-tweaked) and may not work on the original ComputerCraft. Also, these have been designed in [FTB Revelation](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/ftb-revelation) and you may run into problems when running other modpacks. If this is the case, please create an issue post (see Contributing/troubleshooting below).

# Install Instructions

The update script relies heavily on [Github by Eric Wieser](https://github.com/eric-wieser/computercraft-github). This is automatically installed in the update process, so simply run ```wget run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EssenceofLuna/ComputerCraftThings/master/update.lua``` on any in-game computer.

This may pop up a few prompts, especially in first time installation.

This will download this repository (the branch associated with your machine, that is) to the directory `ComputerCraftThings/`.

To update, simply run `update.lua` at any time.

# FAQ

**Q)** Why are there no releases? How do I download *x* script? How do I update?

**A)** All installation and updating is currently handled in game. Refer to the *install instructions* section above for more info. In the future, I may create releases for different versions/scripts. If you only want to download/run a single script, follow these instructions: 1) Navigate to the script you want to run/download. 2) Above the code, click `raw` to see the raw code. 3) Copy the URL you are taken to. 4) In game, run `wget [run] <link you just coppied>`. Include `run` if you only want to run it once instead of downloading. If you're

**Q)** Every time I break my computer/turtle the codes delete themselves!

**A)** Every time you break a computer in CC, it resets it to factory settings. Simply use the `label <name>` command to name your computer. This will make it remember what programs it had when picked up.
